#Tetris with React.js

This project consists of a full stack web application (hosted [here](https://matt-react-tetris.herokuapp.com) on heroku) built with a React frontend, a Node/Express backend and data storage using MongoDB (aka the MERN stack). The core function of the webapp is a recreation of the classic game "Tetris" using React.js, in addition to user signup/login/highscore tracking functions using the backend.

##Game Background

Tetris is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the game's rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage Tetris licensing.

In Tetris, players must complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, the players must last longer than their opponents, and in certain versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some adaptations have provided variations to the game's theme, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces.
